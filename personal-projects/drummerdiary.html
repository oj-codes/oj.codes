          <h2>Project Overview</h2>
          <p>
            The Drummer Stats Tracker is a lightweight, browser-based journal
            designed to motivate and document my journey to 10,000 hours of
            drumming mastery. Built in a single lunch break, the tracker
            provides an intuitive interface for logging daily practice hours,
            band rehearsals, and live performances. It visualizes progress
            toward the 10,000-hour goal with a dynamic progress bar, tracks
            songs learned versus those in progress, and organizes 40 essential
            drum rudiments by difficulty tier.
          </p>
          <p>
            By leveraging plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application
            requires no backend and works seamlessly across devices. Within
            minutes of completing the prototype, I deployed the app to GitHub
            Pages under a custom domain, enabling instant, secure access to my
            personal stats and reinforcing consistent practice habits through
            immediate feedback.

            <li>Data persistence using localStorage</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Implementation Details</h2>
          <p>
            I kickstarted the Drummer Stats Tracker during a single lunch break
            by researching similar tools, discovering
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.surferdiary.com"
              >surferdiary.com</a
            >, and then hand-coding a quick prototype in plain HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. In roughly 20 minutes, I had the core UI in place: a
            dynamic progress bar, input fields for logging practice hours,
            performances, and song statuses, plus a static list of 40 rudiments
            organized by difficulty and a section displaying my current drum
            kit. To polish the look and feel, I briefly experimented with Cursor
            AI suggestions but ultimately refined the CSS and JavaScript by hand
            to ensure clean, efficient code and full responsive support across
            mobile and desktop.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once the alpha version met my criteria, I pushed the code to a new
            GitHub repository, turned on GitHub Pages hosting, and linked my
            Namecheap domain via custom DNS records. I enabled SSL in the Pages
            settings and pointed everything at the main branch, so that within
            ten minutes of finishing development the tracker was live and
            secure. The result is a lightweight, browser-based journal that
            tracks every facet of my drumming journey toward 10,000 hours with
            zero backend dependencies.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <p>
            Working within the confines of a single lunch break demanded rapid
            prototyping without sacrificing usability. To meet this tight
            deadline, I skipped elaborate mockups and dived straight into
            hand-coding the core functionality in plain HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. This approach let me flesh out the progress bar,
            statistics cards, achievements,song list, rudiment list, and drum
            kit showcase section in under twenty minutes, ensuring a working
            alpha by the end of the break.
          </p>
          <p>
            Early experiments with Cursor AI for styling and code suggestions
            introduced unexpected inefficiencies and hallucinated snippets that
            didn’t align with the project’s lightweight goals. Recognizing this,
            I selectively applied only the AI’s most reliable recommendations
            and reverted the rest, refining the UI and JavaScript manually to
            maintain clean, performant code.
          </p>
          <p>
            Delivering a seamless experience across phones, tablets, and
            desktops meant tackling responsive styling challenges on the fly. I
            adopted a mobile-first CSS strategy, used flexible layouts and media
            queries, and tested the tracker in multiple browsers to guarantee
            that all components — from the progress bar to the drum kit section
            — remained functional and visually coherent.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, taking the app live in under ten minutes demanded a
            frictionless deployment. I pushed the repository to GitHub, enabled
            Pages hosting, configured custom DNS records through Namecheap, and
            activated SSL with a single toggle in the Pages settings. This
            streamlined release process ensured that the tracker was both
            instantly accessible and secure, reinforcing its role as a reliable
            practice companion.
          </p>

          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>
            This project is still in early alpha. I'm using it to track my
            progress and to help me stay motivated.
          </p>
          <p>
            I will post improvement metrics and updates here as I develop the
            project.
