## GitHub Pages Deployment

This site is automatically deployed to GitHub Pages using GitHub Actions. The deployment process is triggered on every push to the main branch.

### Setup GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository settings on GitHub
2. Navigate to "Pages" under "Code and automation"
3. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: Select "GitHub Actions"
   - Branch: Select "main"

### Manual Deployment

You can manually trigger a deployment by:

1. Going to the "Actions" tab in your repository
2. Selecting the "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflow
3. Clicking "Run workflow"

### Contact Form Setup

The contact form uses [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/) for form submission. To set up the contact form:

1. Go to [Web3Forms](https://web3forms.com/)
2. Click "Get Access Key"
3. Choose your preferred authentication method (Email, GitHub, or Google)
4. Copy your access key
5. Replace `YOUR_ACCESS_KEY` in the contact form's `data-access-key` attribute with your actual access key

The form will automatically handle:

- Email delivery
- Spam protection
- Form validation
- Success/error messages
- File attachments (if enabled)

Note: Web3Forms is free for up to 250 submissions per month. For higher volumes, consider their paid plans.

### Common Issues

1. **Node.js not found**:

   - Install Node.js using Homebrew: `brew install node`
   - Or download from https://nodejs.org/

2. **Port 3000 already in use**:

   - Change the port in `server.js`
   - Or kill the process using the port: `lsof -i :3000` then `kill -9 PID`

3. **GitHub Pages not updating**:
   - Wait a few minutes for changes to propagate
   - Clear your browser cache
   - Check repository settings
